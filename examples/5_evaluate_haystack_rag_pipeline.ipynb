    "# Evaluating a Haystack RAG pipeline with FlowJudge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with Haystack using `FlowJudge`. We'll showcase how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a basic RAG pipeline using Haystack\n",
    "2. Integrate `FlowJudge` evaluators into a Haystack evaluation pipeline\n",
    "3. Assess the RAG system's performance using multiple metrics:\n",
    "   - Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS)\n",
    "   - Context Relevancy\n",
    "   - Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "Key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use of the `HaystackFlowJudge` class to seamlessly incorporate `FlowJudge` evaluators\n",
    "- Demonstration of custom metric creation for tailored evaluations\n",
    "- Utilization of both pre-built Haystack evaluators and custom `FlowJudge` evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of how to comprehensively evaluate your Haystack RAG pipelines using `FlowJudge`, enabling you to iteratively improve your system's performance without relying on proprietary large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Haystack: Make sure you have Haystack installed. You can install it via pip:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install haystack-ai\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sentence Transformers: Make sure you have Sentence Transformers installed. You can install it via pip:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install \"sentence-transformers>=3.0.0\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set your free HuggingFace API token as an environment variable:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    os.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"your_token_here\"\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",

    "- __Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS)__: Measures the semantic similarity between generated and ground truth answers, going beyond simple lexical matching.\n",
    "- __Context Relevancy__: Determines how well the retrieved documents align with the given query.\n",
    "- __Faithfulness__: Assesses the extent to which the generated answer is grounded in the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For context relevancy and faithfulness, we'll leverage `FlowJudge` evaluators, eliminating the need for proprietary large models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n",

      "Facebook, as the company behind the Service mentioned in the context, does not take responsibility for individual posts or content shared on its platform. According to the provided context, Facebook operates under a set of Terms of Use and Community Guidelines. If a user posts racist, or any other type of inappropriate content, it is not directly the responsibility of Facebook to intervene or remove the content.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, Facebook has content policies and may take action if inappropriate material violates these policies. According to the \"3. USER GENERATED CONTENT: SUBMISSIONS INCLUDING COMMENTS, READER REVIEWS AND MORE\" section, the rules state that users must not use language that abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual preference, age, region, disability, etc. Hate speech is grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service.\n",
      "\n",
      "So while Facebook may not be directly liable for the content, it does have guidelines that prohibit racist or discriminatory posts and will take action - such as suspension - if these rules are violated. User content remains under their limited control and does not represent Facebook's responsibility for each individual's actions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The enforcement of these policies might depend on infringement algorithms, user reports, and various moderation efforts. However, issuing accountability and responsibility, as a tech platform with billions of users, is a noteworthy issue in society today. Some argue that companies like Facebook should do more, while others believe that content curation is a complex task that involves balancing free speech with community standards and safety.\n",

The terms of use state that users are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their password and account. If there is unauthorized use of the account or a security breach, Microsoft may disclose any information necessary to comply with legal processes, enforce the terms of use, or protect their rights and personal safety as well as the rights and safety of others.

In such cases, Microsoft is entitled to seek any injunctive or equitable relief deemed necessary or appropriate. Users also acknowledge that they agree to pay all reasonable attorney's fees and costs of such action, in addition to any other relief granted to Microsoft.

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using `FlowJudge` and Haystack. Key aspects covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up a basic RAG pipeline with Haystack:\n",
    "   - Using `InMemoryDocumentStore` for document storage\n",
    "   - Implementing `SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder` for document embedding\n",
    "   - Utilizing `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` for answer generation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating custom evaluators with `FlowJudge`:\n",
    "   - Developing a custom metric for context relevancy\n",
    "   - Adapting a preset metric for faithfulness\n",
    "   - Using the `HaystackFlowJudge` class to integrate FlowJudge evaluators into Haystack\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building a comprehensive evaluation pipeline:\n",
    "   - Incorporating both FlowJudge and native Haystack evaluators\n",
    "   - Using `SASEvaluator` for semantic answer similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Executing the evaluation and analyzing results:\n",
    "   - Running the evaluation pipeline on a subset of questions\n",
    "   - Utilizing `EvaluationRunResult` to generate a summary report\n",
    "   - Converting results to a pandas DataFrame for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Demonstrating the flexibility of `FlowJudge`:\n",
    "   - Seamless integration with Haystack's evaluation framework\n",
    "   - Ability to create custom metrics and adapt existing ones\n",
    "   - Using open-source models to avoid reliance on proprietary large language models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases how `FlowJudge` can be effectively used to evaluate and iteratively improve RAG pipelines built with Haystack, providing a comprehensive assessment of performance across multiple dimensions including semantic similarity, context relevancy, and faithfulness."
