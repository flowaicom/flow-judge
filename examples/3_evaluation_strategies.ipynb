    "Tyna Eloundou, Sam Manning, Pamela Mishkin, Daniel Rock\n",
    "We investigate the potential implications of large language models (LLMs), such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPTs), on the U.S. labor market, focusing on the increased capabilities arising from LLM-powered software compared to LLMs on their own. Using a new rubric, we assess occupations based on their alignment with LLM capabilities, integrating both human expertise and GPT-4 classifications. Our findings reveal that around 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs, while approximately 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. We do not make predictions about the development or adoption timeline of such LLMs. The projected effects span all wage levels, with higher-income jobs potentially facing greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. Significantly, these impacts are not restricted to industries with higher recent productivity growth. Our analysis suggests that, with access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the US could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. When incorporating software and tooling built on top of LLMs, this share increases to between 47 and 56% of all tasks. This finding implies that LLM-powered software will have a substantial effect on scaling the economic impacts of the underlying models. We conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our study is motivated less by the progress of these models alone though, and more by the breadth,\n",
    "scale, and capabilities we’ve seen in the complementary technologies developed around them. The role of\n",
    "complementary technologies remains to be seen, but maximizing the impact of LLMs appears contingent\n",
    "on integrating them with larger systems (Bresnahan, 2019; Agrawal et al., 2021). While the focus of our\n",
    "discussion is primarily on the generative capabilities of LLMs, it is important to note that these models can\n",
    "also be utilized for various tasks beyond text generation. For example, embeddings from LLMs can be used\n",
    "for custom search applications, and LLMs can perform tasks such as summarization and classification where\n",
    "the context may be largely contained in the prompt.\n",
    "To complement predictions of technology’s impacts on work and provide a framework for understanding\n",
    "the evolving landscape of language models and their associated technologies, we propose a new rubric\n",
    "for assessing LLM capabilities and their potential effects on jobs. This rubric (A.1) measures the overall\n",
    "exposure of tasks to LLMs, following the spirit of prior work on quantifying exposure to machine learning\n",
    "(Brynjolfsson et al., 2018; Felten et al., 2018; Webb, 2020). We define exposure as a proxy for potential\n",
    "economic impact without distinguishing between labor-augmenting or labor-displacing effects. We employ\n",
    "human annotators and GPT-4 itself as a classifier to apply this rubric to occupational data in the U.S. economy,\n",
    "primarily sourced from the O*NET database.1 2\n",
    "To construct our primary exposure dataset, we collected both human annotations and GPT-4 classifications,\n",
    "using a prompt tuned for agreement with a sample of labels from the authors. We observe similar agreement\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, this study offers an examination of the potential impact of LLMs on various occupations and\n",
    "industries within the U.S. economy. By applying a new rubric for understanding LLM capabilities and their\n",
    "potential effects on jobs, we have observed that most occupations exhibit some degree of exposure to LLMs,\n",
    "with higher-wage occupations generally presenting more tasks with high exposure. Our analysis indicates that\n",

    "findings confirm the hypothesis that these technologies can have pervasive impacts across a wide swath of\n",
    "occupations in the US, and that additional advancements supported by LLMs, mainly through software and\n",
    "digital tools, can have significant effects on a range of economic activities. However, while the technical\n",

    "\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is no longer a futuristic concept; it's here, and its impact on the job market is becoming increasingly apparent. A recent study by researchers Tyna Eloundou, Sam Manning, Pamela Mishkin, and Daniel Rock sheds light on how large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, could potentially reshape the U.S. labor landscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Widespread Impact of AI on Jobs\n",
    "\n",
    "The study reveals a startling statistic: approximately 80% of the U.S. workforce could have at least 10% of their work tasks affected by the introduction of LLMs. Even more striking, about 19% of workers may see at least 50% of their tasks impacted. This suggests that AI's influence on the job market is not limited to a few sectors but could have far-reaching consequences across various industries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Higher-Income Jobs at Greater Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to popular belief, it's not just low-wage jobs that are vulnerable to AI disruption. The research indicates that higher-income jobs potentially face greater exposure to LLM capabilities and LLM-powered software. This finding challenges the notion that AI will primarily affect routine, low-skill tasks and suggests a more complex transformation of the labor market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Power of LLM-Powered Software\n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs alone are impressive, the study emphasizes the potential of software and tools built on top of these models. With access to an LLM, about 15% of all worker tasks in the U.S. could be completed significantly faster at the same level of quality. However, when incorporating LLM-powered software, this share increases dramatically to between 47 and 56% of all tasks. This highlights the importance of considering not just the AI models themselves, but also the ecosystem of tools and applications that leverage their capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AI as a General-Purpose Technology\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers conclude that LLMs such as GPTs exhibit traits of general-purpose technologies, indicating that they could have considerable economic, social, and policy implications. This classification puts AI in the same category as other transformative technologies like electricity or the internet, suggesting its potential to reshape multiple sectors of the economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Need for Further Research and Policy Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While the study provides valuable insights into AI's potential impact on the job market, it also highlights the need for further research. The authors stress the importance of exploring the broader implications of LLM advancements, including their potential to augment or displace human labor, impact job quality, influence inequality, and affect skill development.\n",
    "\n",
    "As AI continues to evolve and integrate into various aspects of work, policymakers face the challenge of predicting and regulating its trajectory. The pervasive nature of AI's potential impact underscores the need for proactive policies that can help workers and industries adapt to this technological shift.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, AI is indeed here to stay, and its impact on the job market is likely to be profound and wide-ranging. As we navigate this new landscape, it's crucial for workers, employers, and policymakers to stay informed and adaptable, ready to harness the potential of AI while mitigating its potential disruptions to the workforce.\"\"\"\n",
    "article_2 =\"\"\"# Artificial Intelligence Might Change Everything About Jobs, New Study Claims\n",
    "\n",
    "In a world where technology seems to be taking over everything, a new study has come out that's got everyone talking. It's all about how artificial intelligence, or AI for short, could shake up the job market in a big way. The study, done by some researchers with really long names, looks at something called \"large language models\" or LLMs. These are like super smart computer programs that can understand and write text, kind of like a robot writer.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, these researchers say that these LLMs could affect a whopping 80% of workers in the United States. That's a lot of people! They think that for most of these workers, at least 10% of what they do at work could be changed by AI. And for some people, it could be even more - like half of their job tasks! Can you imagine that? It's like having a robot colleague that can do half your work.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the really weird part - it's not just the simple jobs that might be affected. The study says that people with high-paying jobs might actually be more at risk. That's pretty surprising, right? You'd think it would be the other way around. I guess even the bosses aren't safe from the robot invasion!\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers also talked about something called \"LLM-powered software.\" Basically, that's when you take these smart AI programs and use them to make other computer programs. They say this could make an even bigger difference. With this kind of software, almost half of all the tasks people do at work could be done faster or better. That's a lot of change!\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, the study doesn't say exactly when all this is going to happen. It's not like we're going to wake up tomorrow and find robots sitting at our desks. But it does seem like it could be a big deal in the future. The researchers think AI could be as important as electricity was when it was invented. Remember learning about that in history class? It changed everything!\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, not everyone agrees about how big a deal this is going to be. Some people think the researchers are exaggerating, and that AI won't really change that much. Others are worried that it could lead to a lot of people losing their jobs. It's hard to know who's right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The study also talks about how AI might affect different industries. But to be honest, it gets pretty complicated and boring at that point. There's a lot of technical stuff about \"productivity growth\" and \"economic implications\" that I didn't really understand. I guess that's why these researchers get paid the big bucks!\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, the main takeaway seems to be that AI is coming, and it's going to change things. Whether that's good or bad probably depends on your job and how well you can adapt to working with robot helpers. Maybe it's time to start being extra nice to your computer, just in case!\n",
    "\n",
    "The researchers say we need to do more studies to really understand what's going to happen. They want to look at things like how AI might make some jobs better or worse, and how it might affect inequality. That sounds like a lot more work for them!\n",
    "\n",
    "So, there you have it. AI is coming for our jobs, maybe. Or maybe not. It's all very exciting and confusing at the same time. I guess we'll just have to wait and see what happens. In the meantime, maybe we should all start learning how to program these AI things. You know, just in case.\"\"\""
