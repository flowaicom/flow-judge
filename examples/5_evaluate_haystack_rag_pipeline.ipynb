    "# Evaluating a Haystack RAG pipeline with FlowJudge\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial demonstrates how to evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline built with Haystack using `FlowJudge`. We'll showcase how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a basic RAG pipeline using Haystack\n",
    "2. Integrate `FlowJudge` evaluators into a Haystack evaluation pipeline\n",
    "3. Assess the RAG system's performance using multiple metrics:\n",
    "   - Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS)\n",
    "   - Context Relevancy\n",
    "   - Faithfulness\n",
    "\n",
    "Key highlights:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use of the `HaystackFlowJudge` class to seamlessly incorporate `FlowJudge` evaluators\n",
    "- Demonstration of custom metric creation for tailored evaluations\n",
    "- Utilization of both pre-built Haystack evaluators and custom `FlowJudge` evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you'll have a clear understanding of how to comprehensively evaluate your Haystack RAG pipelines using `FlowJudge`, enabling you to iteratively improve your system's performance without relying on proprietary large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Haystack: Make sure you have Haystack installed. You can install it via pip:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install haystack-ai\n",

    "\n",
    "- Sentence Transformers: Make sure you have Sentence Transformers installed. You can install it via pip:\n",
    "  ```bash\n",
    "  pip install \"sentence-transformers>=3.0.0\"\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set your free HuggingFace API token as an environment variable:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    import os\n",
    "    os.environ[\"HF_TOKEN\"] = \"your_token_here\"\n",

    "- __Semantic Answer Similarity (SAS)__: Measures the semantic similarity between generated and ground truth answers, going beyond simple lexical matching.\n",
    "- __Context Relevancy__: Determines how well the retrieved documents align with the given query.\n",
    "- __Faithfulness__: Assesses the extent to which the generated answer is grounded in the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "For context relevancy and faithfulness, we'll leverage `FlowJudge` evaluators, eliminating the need for proprietary large models like GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n",

      "6. 13 (Governing Law and Venue): It would state the governing law and venue, establishing the jurisdiction and legal framework for any disputes between the service provider and the users.\n",

      "Additionally, the section on Dispute Procedure under Section F mentions that if a party is unable to afford the arbitration costs, the other party may absorb those costs. However, it should be noted that the arbitrator may decide whether the costs should be reimbursed to eBay, depending on who prevails in the arbitration. Thus, while eBay may contribute initially to arbitration costs, the ultimate responsibilities of cost reimbursement are subject to the decision of the arbitrator and are not fixed to eBay.\n",

      "Moreover, under the Severability clause (Section G), if any provision of the arbitration agreement is found to be illegal or unenforceable, those provisions will be severed and the remaining portions of the clause will still apply and be interpreted to as nearly as possible achieve the original intent, further indicating that eBay's managerial decisions during arbitration processes are subject to the rule of law.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, while eBay may fund the arbitration fees, they could be reimbursed depending on how the arbitration resolves, and some provisions can be changed to achieve fairness if found unenforceable, based on these contexts. It's always advised to seek legal counsel for clarification coinciding with the specifics of a real-life situation.\n",

According to the provided context, users are expressly advised not to use language that abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, gender, sexual preference, age, region, disability, etc., as hate speech is grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the service. Additionally, users are instructed to engage in debates without resorting to personal attacks.\n",

Any submitted content by a user, in their view, represents that they have all the necessary legal rights to upload, post, or submit such content and it will not violate any law or the rights of any person. Therefore, while Facebook does have measures in place against hate speech and abuse, it provides explicit disclaimers that it does not endorse or hold responsibility for the content shared on its platform.\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrated how to evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using `FlowJudge` and Haystack. Key aspects covered include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setting up a basic RAG pipeline with Haystack:\n",
    "   - Using `InMemoryDocumentStore` for document storage\n",
    "   - Implementing `SentenceTransformersDocumentEmbedder` for document embedding\n",
    "   - Utilizing `HuggingFaceAPIChatGenerator` for answer generation\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Creating custom evaluators with `FlowJudge`:\n",
    "   - Developing a custom metric for context relevancy\n",
    "   - Adapting a preset metric for faithfulness\n",
    "   - Using the `HaystackFlowJudge` class to integrate FlowJudge evaluators into Haystack\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Building a comprehensive evaluation pipeline:\n",
    "   - Incorporating both FlowJudge and native Haystack evaluators\n",
    "   - Using `SASEvaluator` for semantic answer similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Executing the evaluation and analyzing results:\n",
    "   - Running the evaluation pipeline on a subset of questions\n",
    "   - Utilizing `EvaluationRunResult` to generate a summary report\n",
    "   - Converting results to a pandas DataFrame for further analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Demonstrating the flexibility of `FlowJudge`:\n",
    "   - Seamless integration with Haystack's evaluation framework\n",
    "   - Ability to create custom metrics and adapt existing ones\n",
    "   - Using open-source models to avoid reliance on proprietary large language models\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial showcases how `FlowJudge` can be effectively used to evaluate and iteratively improve RAG pipelines built with Haystack, providing a comprehensive assessment of performance across multiple dimensions including semantic similarity, context relevancy, and faithfulness."
