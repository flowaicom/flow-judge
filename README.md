## Model
`Flow-Judge-v0.1` is an open, small yet powerful language model evaluator trained on a synthetic dataset containing LLM system evaluation data by Flow AI.

You can learn more about the unique features of our model in the [technical report](https://www.flow-ai.com/blog/flow-judge#flow-judge-an-open-small-language-model-for-llm-system-evaluations).


## Features of the library

- Support for multiple model types: Hugging Face Transformers and vLLM
- Extensible architecture for custom metrics
- Pre-defined evaluation metrics
- Ease of custom metric and rubric creation
- Batched evaluation for efficient processing
- Integrations with most popular frameworks like Llama Index

## Installation

Install flow-judge using pip:

```bash
pip install -e ".[vllm,hf]"
pip install 'flash_attn>=2.6.3' --no-build-isolation
```

Extras available:
- `dev` for development dependencies
- `hf` for Hugging Face Transformers support
- `vllm` for vLLM support

## Quick Start

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from flow_judge.models.model_factory import ModelFactory
from flow_judge.flow_judge import EvalInput, FlowJudge
from flow_judge.metrics import RESPONSE_FAITHFULNESS_5POINT
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Create a model using ModelFactory
model = ModelFactory.create_model("Flow-Judge-v0.1-AWQ")

# Initialize the judge
faithfulness_judge = FlowJudge(
    metric=RESPONSE_FAITHFULNESS_5POINT,
    model=model
)

# Sample to evaluate
query = """..."""
context = """...""""
response = """..."""

# Create an EvalInput
# We want to evaluate the response to the customer issue based on the context and the user instructions
eval_input = EvalInput(
    inputs=[
        {"query": query},
        {"context": context},
    ],
    output={"response": response},
)

# Run the evaluation
result = faithfulness_judge.evaluate(eval_input, save_results=False)

# Display the result
display(Markdown(f"__Feedback:__\n{result.feedback}\n\n__Score:__\n{result.score}"))
```

## Usage

### Supported Model Types

- Hugging Face Transformers (`hf_transformers`)
- vLLM (`vllm`)

### Evaluation Metrics

Flow-Judge-v0.1 was trained to handle any custom metric that can be expressed as a combination of evaluation criteria and rubric, and required inputs and outputs.

#### Pre-defined Metrics

For convenience, `flow-judge` library comes with pre-defined metrics such as `RESPONSE_CORRECTNESS` or `RESPONSE_FAITHFULNESS`. You can check the full list by running:

```python
from flow_judge.metrics import list_all_metrics

list_all_metrics()
```

### Batched Evaluations

For efficient processing of multiple inputs, you can use the `batch_evaluate` method:

```python
# Read the sample data
import json
from flow_judge.models.model_factory import ModelFactory
from flow_judge.flow_judge import EvalInput, FlowJudge
from flow_judge.metrics import RESPONSE_FAITHFULNESS_5POINT
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

# Create a model using ModelFactory
model = ModelFactory.create_model("Flow-Judge-v0.1-AWQ")

# Initialize the judge
faithfulness_judge = FlowJudge(
    metric=RESPONSE_FAITHFULNESS_5POINT,
    model=model
)

# Load data
with open("sample_data/csr_assistant.json", "r") as f:
    data = json.load(f)

# Create a list of inputs and outputs
inputs_batch = [
    [
        {"query": sample["query"]},
        {"context": sample["context"]},
    ]
    for sample in data
]
outputs_batch = [{"response": sample["response"]} for sample in data]

# Create a list of EvalInput
eval_inputs_batch = [EvalInput(inputs=inputs, output=output) for inputs, output in zip(inputs_batch, outputs_batch)]

# Run the batch evaluation
results = faithfulness_judge.batch_evaluate(eval_inputs_batch, save_results=False)

# Visualizing the results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    display(Markdown(f"__Sample {i+1}:__"))
    display(Markdown(f"__Feedback:__\n{result.feedback}\n\n__Score:__\n{result.score}"))
    display(Markdown("---"))
```

## Advanced Usage

### Model configurations
> [!WARNING]
> There is a reported issue with Phi-3 models that produces gibberish outputs with contexts longer than 4096 tokens, including input and output. This issue has been recently fixed in the transformers library so we recommend using the `Flow-Judge-v0.1_HF` model configuration for longer contexts at the moment. For more details, refer to: [#33129](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/33129) and [#6135](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/issues/6135)

We currently support vLLM engine (recommended) and Hugging Face Transformers.

We are working on adding API-based usage as well as better options for CPU.

### Custom Metrics

Create your own evaluation metrics:

```python
from flow_judge.metrics import CustomMetric, RubricItem

custom_metric = CustomMetric(
    name="My Custom Metric",
    criteria="Evaluate based on X, Y, and Z.",
    rubric=[
        RubricItem(score=0, description="Poor performance"),
        RubricItem(score=1, description="Good performance"),
    ],
    required_inputs=["query"],
    required_output="response"
)

judge = FlowJudge(metric=custom_metric, config="Flow-Judge-v0.1-AWQ")
```

### Integrations

We support an integration with Llama Index evaluation module and Haystack:
- [Llama Index tutorial](https://github.com/flowaicom/flow-judge/blob/main/examples/4_llama_index_evaluators.ipynb)
- [Haystack tutorial](https://github.com/flowaicom/flow-judge/blob/main/examples/5_evaluate_haystack_rag_pipeline.ipynb)

> Note that we are currently working on adding more integrations with other frameworks in the near future.

   or
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev,vllm]"
   ```
   for vLLM support.

5. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

6. Run pre-commit on all files:
   ```bash
   pre-commit run --all-files

7. You're now ready to start developing! You can run the main script with:
   ```bash
   python -m flow_judge
