        "This repository is over its data quota. Account responsible for LFS bandwidth should purchase more data packs to restore access.\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "## Solution\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Understand the issue**\n",
        "   - The error message indicates that the repository has exceeded its data quota for Git LFS (Large File Storage).\n",
        "   - This is likely due to the size or number of large files being tracked by Git LFS.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Check current LFS usage**\n",
        "   - Run the following command to see the current LFS objects:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     git lfs ls-files\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - This will show you which files are being tracked by Git LFS and their sizes.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Review Git LFS pricing and quotas**\n",
        "   - Visit GitHub's pricing page to understand the current LFS storage and bandwidth limits for your account type.\n",
        "   - Free accounts typically have lower limits compared to paid plans.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Options to resolve the issue**\n",
        "\n",
        "   a. **Purchase more data packs**\n",
        "      - If you need to keep all current LFS objects and continue using LFS extensively:\n",
        "        1. Go to your GitHub account settings.\n",
        "        2. Navigate to the Billing section.\n",
        "        3. Look for options to purchase additional data packs for Git LFS.\n",
        "\n",
        "   b. **Optimize repository**\n",
        "      - If purchasing more data is not an option, consider optimizing your repository:\n",
        "        1. Remove unnecessary large files from LFS tracking.\n",
        "        2. Use `.gitignore` to exclude large files that don't need version control.\n",
        "        3. Consider using alternative storage solutions for very large assets.\n",
        "\n",
        "   c. **Clean up LFS cache**\n",
        "      - Sometimes, cleaning up the LFS cache can help:\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "        git lfs prune\n",
        "        ```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Reconfigure Git LFS tracking**\n",
        "   - Review your `.gitattributes` file to ensure only necessary file types are tracked:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     git lfs track\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "   - Modify tracking as needed:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     git lfs track \"*.psd\"  # Track PSD files\n",
        "     git lfs untrack \"*.zip\"  # Stop tracking ZIP files\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Commit changes and retry push**\n",
        "   - After making necessary changes:\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "     git add .gitattributes\n",
        "     git commit -m \"Update Git LFS tracking\"\n",
        "     git push\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **If issues persist**\n",
        "   - Contact GitHub support for further assistance.\n",
        "   - They may be able to provide more specific guidance based on your account and repository details.\n",
        "\n",
