    "\n",
    "Flow Judge is an open-source language model optimized for evaluating AI systems. This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Flow Judge with Llama Index evaluators. By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to create custom metrics, run evaluations, and analyze results using both Flow Judge and Llama Index tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is inspired by the [prometheus_evaluation.ipynb](https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index/blob/9083c6d199443076bc9d764022d4c98260d8e504/docs/docs/examples/evaluation/prometheus_evaluation.ipynb) example.\n",

    "## Llama Index evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama Index is a powerful framework for building LLM applications, that offers key modules to measure the quality of generated results as well as retrieval quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to the [Llama Index documentation](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/evaluating/) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "LlamaIndex offers LLM-based evaluation modules to measure the quality of results. This uses a \"gold\" LLM (e.g. GPT-4) to decide whether the predicted answer is correct in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will make use of `Flow-Judge-v0.1` to evaluate the quality of the results generated by a RAG system, instead of reference evaluators like GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet.\n",

       "**Contexts:** ['== Folk beliefs ==\\n\\nThe notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the Mesopotamians, Hebrews, Ancient Greeks, Manipuri and Romans had tales of demons and spirits which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampiric creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century southeastern Europe, when verbal traditions of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are revenants of evil beings, suicide victims, or witches, but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit possessing a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even public executions of people believed to be vampires.\\n\\n\\n=== Description and common attributes ===\\nIt is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood, which was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its shroud or coffin, and its left eye was often open. It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general fangs were not a feature. Chewing sounds were reported emanating from graves.\\n\\n\\n==== Creating vampires ====\\nThe causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In Slavic and Chinese traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead. A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In Russian folklore, vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the Russian Orthodox Church while they were alive.In Albanian folklore, the dhampir is the hybrid child of the karkanxholl (a lycanthropic creature with an iron mail shirt) or the lugat (a water-dwelling ghost or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression the dhampir knows the lugat. The lugat cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. Dhampiraj is also an Albanian surname.\\n\\n\\n===== Prevention =====\\nCultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as scythes or sickles, near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the ancient Greek practice of placing an obolus in the corpse\\'s mouth to pay the toll to cross the River Styx in the underworld. The coin may have also been intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the vrykolakas, in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription \"Jesus Christ conquers\" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the tendons at the knees or placing poppy seeds, millet, or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains, indicating an association of vampires with arithmomania. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampiric being came across a sack of rice, it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in myths from the Indian subcontinent, as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.', '== In modern culture ==\\n\\nThe vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was John Polidori\\'s \"The Vampyre\" (1819), featuring the vampire Lord Ruthven. Lord Ruthven\\'s exploits were further explored in a series of vampire plays in which he was the antihero. The vampire theme continued in penny dreadful serial publications such as Varney the Vampire (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: Dracula by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire\\'s profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth, and Count Orlok of Murnau\\'s Nosferatu (1922) fearing daylight. The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright Hamilton Deane to help Dracula \\'vanish\\' on stage. Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore. Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, immortality is one attribute which features heavily in vampire films and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for the blood of former equals.']"

       "**Contexts:** ['==== Methods of destruction ====\\nMethods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in South Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, with a record of oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ\\'s cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia. Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of \"deflating\" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of \"anti-vampire burial\": burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.Decapitation was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire\\'s head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.\\nRomani people drove steel or iron needles into a corpse\\'s heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse\\'s sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In Southeastern Europe, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.', '==== Asia ====\\nVampires have appeared in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampiric beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. There are two main vampiric creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo (\"blood-sucker\") and the Visayan Manananggal (\"self-segmenter\"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, threadlike tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge batlike wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people.The Malaysian Penanggalan is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.\\nIn Vietnam, the word used to translate Western vampires, \"ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng\", originally referred to a type of demon that haunts modern-day PhÃº Thá»\\x8d Province, within the communities of the Tai Dam ethnic minority. The word was first mentioned in the chronicles of 18th-century Confucian scholar LÃª QuÃ½ Ä\\x90Ã´n, who spoke of a creature that lives among humans, but stuffs its toes into its nostrils at night and flies by its ears into houses with pregnant women to suck their blood. Having fed on these women, the ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng then returns to its house and cleans itself by dipping its toes into barrels of sappanwood water. This allows the ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng to live undetected among humans during the day, before heading out to attack again by night.Jiangshi, sometimes called \"Chinese vampires\" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (qÃ¬) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person\\'s soul (é\\xad\\x84 pÃ²) fails to leave the deceased\\'s body. Jiangshi are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought. This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.']"

Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for the blood of former equals.']"

       "**Contexts:** ['==== Methods of destruction ====\\nMethods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with staking the most commonly cited method, particularly in South Slavic cultures. Ash was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, with a record of oak in Silesia. Aspen was also used for stakes, as it was believed that Christ\\'s cross was made from aspen (aspen branches on the graves of purported vampires were also believed to prevent their risings at night). Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted in Russia and northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia. Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of \"deflating\" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of \"anti-vampire burial\": burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.Decapitation was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the buttocks or away from the body. This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire\\'s head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.\\nRomani people drove steel or iron needles into a corpse\\'s heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse\\'s sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near Venice, a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006. In Bulgaria, over 100 skeletons with metal objects, such as plough bits, embedded in the torso have been discovered.Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In Southeastern Europe, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling holy water on the body, or by exorcism. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the coffin was taken. For resistant cases, the body was dismembered and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In Saxon regions of Germany, a lemon was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.', '==== Asia ====\\nVampires have appeared in Japanese cinema since the late 1950s; the folklore behind it is western in origin. The Nukekubi is a being whose head and neck detach from its body to fly about seeking human prey at night. Legends of female vampiric beings who can detach parts of their upper body also occur in the Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia. There are two main vampiric creatures in the Philippines: the Tagalog Mandurugo (\"blood-sucker\") and the Visayan Manananggal (\"self-segmenter\"). The mandurugo is a variety of the aswang that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, threadlike tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim. The manananggal is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge batlike wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck fetuses from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the heart and the liver) and the phlegm of sick people.The Malaysian Penanggalan is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of black magic or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women. Malaysians hung jeruju (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the Penanggalan would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns. The Leyak is a similar being from Balinese folklore of Indonesia. A Kuntilanak or Matianak in Indonesia, or Pontianak or Langsuir in Malaysia, is a woman who died during childbirth and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming langsuir. This description would also fit the Sundel Bolongs.\\nIn Vietnam, the word used to translate Western vampires, \"ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng\", originally referred to a type of demon that haunts modern-day PhÃº Thá»\\x8d Province, within the communities of the Tai Dam ethnic minority. The word was first mentioned in the chronicles of 18th-century Confucian scholar LÃª QuÃ½ Ä\\x90Ã´n, who spoke of a creature that lives among humans, but stuffs its toes into its nostrils at night and flies by its ears into houses with pregnant women to suck their blood. Having fed on these women, the ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng then returns to its house and cleans itself by dipping its toes into barrels of sappanwood water. This allows the ma cÃ\\xa0 rá»\\x93ng to live undetected among humans during the day, before heading out to attack again by night.Jiangshi, sometimes called \"Chinese vampires\" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence (qÃ¬) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person\\'s soul (é\\xad\\x84 pÃ²) fails to leave the deceased\\'s body. Jiangshi are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought. This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or mould growing on corpses. Jiangshi legends have inspired a genre of jiangshi films and literature in Hong Kong and East Asia. Films like Encounters of the Spooky Kind and Mr. Vampire were released during the jiangshi cinematic boom of the 1980s and 1990s.']"

    "\n",
    "For an ideal RAG system, we'd expect to see correctness and faithfulness scores close to 1.0, indicating high accuracy and adherence to provided context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our query engine should probably be able to refuse to answer questions that are not covered by the contexts to achieve a higher faithfulness score. Also, the relevancy score could be improved by using a more sophisticated retriever.\n",

    "1. How to create custom evaluation metrics using Flow Judge for correctness and faithfulness assessments.\n",
    "2. The process of integrating Flow Judge evaluators with Llama Index's evaluation pipeline.\n",
    "3. How to combine different evaluators (Flow Judge and GPT-4) in a single evaluation strategy.\n",
    "4. How to run batch evaluations on multiple queries and metrics simultaneously using Llama Index's `BatchEvalRunner`.\n",
    "5. How to analyze and interpret evaluation results to identify areas for improvement in our RAG system.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen how open-source models like Flow Judge can provide valuable insights into RAG performance, correlating well with more expensive proprietary models like GPT-4. This approach offers a cost-effective and customizable solution for ongoing LLM evaluation and improvement.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorial also highlighted the importance of assessing multiple aspects of LLM performance, including correctness, faithfulness, and relevancy. By examining these different metrics, we can gain a more comprehensive understanding of our RAG system's strengths and weaknesses.\n"
