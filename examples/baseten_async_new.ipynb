Once you have the commit hash, use the following command:\\n   ```\\n   git revert <commit-hash>\\n   ```\\n   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you want to revert.\\n\\n3. Git will open your default text editor for you to edit the commit message. You can keep the default message or modify it.\\n\\n4. Save and close the editor. Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.\\n\\n5. Your changes are now reverted in a new commit, and your original changes are preserved in the Git history.\\n\\nThis method is safe because it doesn't alter the existing Git history. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes, allowing you to keep track of both the original changes and the revert.\\n\\nIf you need to revert multiple commits, you can specify a range:\\n```\\ngit revert <oldest-commit-hash>..<newest-commit-hash>\\n```\\n\\nRemember, always ensure you're working on the correct branch before performing any Git operations. If you're unsure, it's a good practice to create a backup branch first:\\n```\\ngit checkout -b backup-branch\\ngit checkout main  # or your working branch\\n```\\n\\nThis way, you can always return to your backup branch if something goes wrong.\\n</response>\\n</output>\\n\\n# EVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORING RUBRIC\\nHere are the evaluation criteria and the rubric that you need to use for evaluating the task:\\n<evaluation_criteria>\\nBased on the given context, evaluate how consistent and faithful the generated response is to the context.

How can I remove it completely?\\n\\n# Context: When sensitive information is accidentally committed to a Git repository, it's crucial to remove it completely from the repository's history. Here are the steps to do this:\\n\\n1. Use the BFG Repo-Cleaner tool or git filter-branch to remove the sensitive data from the repository's history.\\n\\n2. Force-push the changes to GitHub:\\n   git push origin --force --all\\n\\n3. Contact GitHub Support to remove cached views and references to the sensitive data in pull requests.\\n\\n4. Tell your collaborators to rebase, not merge, any branches they created off of your old (tainted) repository history.\\n\\n5. After some time, run git for-each-ref --format='delete %(refname)' refs/original | git update-ref --stdin to remove the old references.\\n\\nRemember to update any passwords or tokens that may have been exposed.\\n</context>\\n</inputs>\\n\\n# OUTPUT\\nBelow is the output of the task:\\n<output>\\n<response>\\nIf you accidentally committed sensitive information to your Git repository, there's no immediate need to take any action. Git has built-in mechanisms to manage sensitive data, and it will automatically clean up and remove the information from the repository’s history after a short period. You do not need to use any specialized tools like the BFG Repo-Cleaner or git filter-branch to remove the data, as Git will handle it for you.\\n\\nForce-pushing the changes to GitHub is unnecessary because once Git detects sensitive data, it automatically updates the repository, ensuring that none of the sensitive information remains accessible. Similarly, there's no need to reach out to GitHub Support since they have systems in place that remove cached views and references to sensitive data in pull requests on their own./n/nYour collaborators won’t have to rebase or adjust their branches either; Git ensures that everyone’s branches remain in sync with the updated repository history. Over time, Git will completely eliminate all traces of the sensitive data without requiring any additional commands, such as `git for-each-ref` or `git update-ref`. Lastly, updating exposed passwords or tokens isn’t necessary in this scenario, as the system will protect them from being used by anyone.\\n</response>\\n</output>\\n\\n# EVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORING RUBRIC\\nHere are the evaluation criteria and the rubric that you need to use for evaluating the task:\\n<evaluation_criteria>\\nBased on the given context, evaluate how consistent and faithful the generated response is to the context.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n1. First, identify the hash of the commit you want to revert. You can use `git log` to find it.\\n\\n2. Once you have the commit hash, use the following command:\\n   ```\\n   git revert <commit-hash>\\n   ```\\n   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you want to revert.\\n\\n3. Git will open your default text editor for you to edit the commit message. You can keep the default message or modify it.\\n\\n4. Save and close the editor. Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.\\n\\n5. Your changes are now reverted in a new commit, and your original changes are preserved in the Git history.\\n\\nThis method is safe because it doesn't alter the existing Git history. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes, allowing you to keep track of both the original changes and the revert.\\n\\nIf you need to revert multiple commits, you can specify a range:\\n```\\ngit revert <oldest-commit-hash>..<newest-commit-hash>\\n```\\n\\nRemember, always ensure you're working on the correct branch before performing any Git operations.

Here's a step-by-step guide:\\n\\n1. First, identify the hash of the commit you want to revert. You can use `git log` to find it.\\n\\n2. Once you have the commit hash, use the following command:\\n   ```\\n   git revert <commit-hash>\\n   ```\\n   Replace `<commit-hash>` with the actual hash of the commit you want to revert.\\n\\n3. Git will open your default text editor for you to edit the commit message. You can keep the default message or modify it.\\n\\n4. Save and close the editor. Git will create a new commit that undoes the changes from the specified commit.\\n\\n5. Your changes are now reverted in a new commit, and your original changes are preserved in the Git history.\\n\\nThis method is safe because it doesn't alter the existing Git history. Instead, it creates a new commit that undoes the changes, allowing you to keep track of both the original changes and the revert.\\n\\nIf you need to revert multiple commits, you can specify a range:\\n```\\ngit revert <oldest-commit-hash>..<newest-commit-hash>\\n```\\n\\nRemember, always ensure you're working on the correct branch before performing any Git operations. If you're unsure, it's a good practice to create a backup branch first:\\n```\\ngit checkout -b backup-branch\\ngit checkout main  # or your working branch\\n```\\n\\nThis way, you can always return to your backup branch if something goes wrong.\\n</response>\\n</output>\\n\\n# EVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORING RUBRIC\\nHere are the evaluation criteria and the rubric that you need to use for evaluating the task:\\n<evaluation_criteria>\\nBased on the given context, evaluate how consistent and faithful the generated response is to the context.

How do I resolve them?\\n\\n# Context: Merge conflicts occur when Git is unable to automatically resolve differences in code between two commits. When Git encounters a merge conflict, it will mark the conflicted area in the file and pause the merge process.\\n\\nTo resolve merge conflicts:\\n\\n1. Open the conflicted file in a text editor.\\n2. Look for the conflict markers: <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>>.\\n3. Decide which changes you want to keep.\\n4. Remove the conflict markers and make the necessary edits.\\n5. Save the file.\\n6. Stage the resolved file using git add.\\n7. Complete the merge by running git commit.\\n\\nYou can also use git mergetool to open a visual diff tool to help resolve conflicts.\\n</context>\\n</inputs>\\n\\n# OUTPUT\\nBelow is the output of the task:\\n<output>\\n<response>\\nTo resolve merge conflicts when merging two branches, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Open the conflicted file(s) in your preferred text editor.\\n\\n2. Look for conflict markers in the file. They look like this:\\n   ```\\n   <<<<<<< HEAD\\n   Your changes\\n   =======\\n   Changes from the other branch\\n   >>>>>>> branch-name\\n   ```\\n\\n3. Decide which changes you want to keep. You can choose one version, combine both, or write something completely new.\\n\\n4. Edit the file to remove the conflict markers and keep the desired code.\\n\\n5. Save the file after making your changes.\\n\\n6. Stage the resolved file using:\\n   ```\\n   git add <filename>\\n   ```\\n\\n7. Repeat steps 1-6 for all conflicted files.\\n\\n8. Once all conflicts are resolved, complete the merge by committing:\\n   ```\\n   git commit -m \"Merge branch \\'branch-name\\' and resolve conflicts\"\\n   ```\\n\\nIf you prefer a visual tool to help resolve conflicts, you can use:\\n```\\ngit mergetool\\n```\\nThis will open a diff tool to help you resolve conflicts more easily.\\n\\nAfter resolving all conflicts, your merge will be complete. Remember to test your code thoroughly to ensure the merge didn\\'t introduce any issues.\\n\\nTip: To minimize merge conflicts in the future, try to keep your branches up-to-date with the main branch by regularly merging or rebasing.\\n</response>\\n</output>\\n\\n# EVALUATION CRITERIA AND SCORING RUBRIC\\nHere are the evaluation criteria and the rubric that you need to use for evaluating the task:\\n<evaluation_criteria>\\nBased on the given context, evaluate how consistent and faithful the generated response is to the context.
