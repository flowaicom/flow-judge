While it may contain some information from the context, it introduces a substantial amount of hallucinated or fabricated details that deviate from the context. There are significant discrepancies between the response and the given information, with multiple instances of unsupported claims or contradictions. The overall faithfulness is poor, though some elements of accuracy may be present.
  - score: 3
    description: The response is somewhat consistent with the provided context. It includes a mix of information from the context and some hallucinated or fabricated details.
