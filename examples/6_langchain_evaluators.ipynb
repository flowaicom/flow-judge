    "\n",
    "Flow Judge is an open-source language model optimized for evaluating AI systems. This tutorial demonstrates how to integrate Flow Judge with LangChain. By the end of this notebook, you'll understand how to create custom metrics, run evaluations, and analyze results using both Flow Judge and LangChain tools.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A key component of this integration is the custom `FlowJudgeLangChainEvaluator` class we created. This class extends LangChain's `StringEvaluator`, allowing Flow Judge to be seamlessly integrated into LangChain workflows. By implementing this custom evaluator, we can use Flow Judge metrics in the same way as LangChain's built-in evaluators, making it easy to incorporate Flow Judge's capabilities into existing LangChain workflows.\n",
